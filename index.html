            <p><h3>Location</h3><br>The precise location of the school can never be uncovered because it is rendered Unplottable. To Muggles, the school appears to be an old, abandoned castle. Similarly, most wizarding schools' locations are protected in order to prevent their ways of teaching being revealed, as well as protect the students and schools themselves from any harm.

<h2>More information</h2>


<p>Children with magical abilities were enrolled at birth, and acceptance was confirmed by owl post at age eleven. However, if the child in question was a Muggle-born or a half-blood like Harry Potter with no knowledge of the wizarding world, a staff member from the school visited the child and his or her family in order to inform them of their magical heritage and the existence of the wizarding world.[11]

    The school's motto was Draco Dormiens Nunquam Titillandus (Draco Dormiens Nvnqvam Titillandvs), which, translated from Latin, means "Never tickle a sleeping dragon".</p>
